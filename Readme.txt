To build this clock we made use of clock function from the library of resources available on p5.js webpage. A simple clock depicting how we can be creative and write our own clock design to display on the browser.
There are lot of resources, libraries and references available on the website which can be made use of to develop something creative and intuitive. A new type of JavaScript created by Lauren McCarthy and is developed by a community of collaborators, with support from the Processing Foundation and NYU ITP.
